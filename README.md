# Alphabet Soup Charity Neural Network Classification Problem
## Purpose
To create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data 
We received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Deliverables: 
### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model later in Deliverable 2.

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.

### Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

### A Written Report on the Neural Network Model
Write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.
